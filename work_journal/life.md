- David sinclair takeaways for healthy life 
    - Eat less often (Skip a meal), don't snack
    - avoid sugary drinks and food
    - reduce meat intake and opt for more plant based diet
    - choose the veggies that are stressed out 
    - Put the sugar at the end of the meal

- [Recommendations for Food intake][Health]
    - Liquid calories are not same as solid calories. Avoid liquid calories as body is not able to effectively apply measuring mechanism as it does with solid calories due to million years of evolution.
    - Things to check,
    - Eat as little as possible.(Eat less often)
    - Pay attention to fructose intake - eat less of super sweet fruits like mangoes and banana and more of less sweet fruits like Melons, guava. Get rid of fruit juices
    - Sugar is 50% glucose and 50% fructose - so consider using Glucon-D instead of white sugar Since it has 100% glucose
    - Honey and jaggery are mostly fructose. So eat less of it. Jaggery is 90% same as sugar. 
    - Starches are actually long chains of glucose.
    - More you feed gut bacteria , good it is. Shift diet to whole grains like red rice,Rajma. reduce maida,ata. Go large on portion of dal and small on rice. Switch to Millets
    - Use ghee.  Fat reduces rate at which blood sugar spikes
    - Getting body into ketosis (16 or more hours of fasting) is very beneficial
    - Veg people should pay attention to protein intake. Eat Dals. Consume dairy products.
    - Stop paying attention to carbohydrates and not fats.
    - Food is bad if coming out of packet. Be as close as you can of animal and plants you are eating. Closer our diets to what our great grand mothers ate, better it is.

- Health (Book: Why we get obese?) 
    - Obesity and overweight, so we’ll be told, are associated with an increased risk of virtually every chronic disease that ails us—heart disease, stroke, diabetes, cancer, dementia, asthma.
    -  two factors will essentially determine how much fat we accumulate, both having to do with the hormone insulin. First, when insulin levels are elevated, we accumulate fat in our fat tissue; when these levels fall, we liberate fat from the fat tissue and burn it for fuel. This has been known since the early 1960s and has never been controversial. Second, our insulin levels are effectively determined by the carbohydrates we eat—not entirely, but for all intents and purposes. The more carbohydrates we eat, and the easier they are to digest and the sweeter they are, the more insulin we will ultimately secrete, meaning that the level of it in our bloodstream is greater and so is the fat we retain in our fat cells.
    - “Carbohydrate is driving insulin is driving fat"
    - the stimulation of insulin secretion caused by eating easily digestible, carbohydrate rich foods: refined carbohydrates, including flour and cereal grains, starchy vegetables such as potatoes, and sugars, like sucrose (table sugar) and high fructose corn syrup. These carbohydrates literally make us fat, and by driving us to accumulate fat, they make us hungrier and they make us sedentary. 

    - FOODS THAT MUST BE EATEN EVERY DAY: 
        - Salad Greens: 2 cups a day.

        deviled eggs.
        - Insulin is the anabolic (building) hormone, and its primary job is to turn excess food into fat for future use. Insulin is a life-saving hormone without which humans wouldn’t have existed for a long time(Imagine storing food as abdominal fat and then giving energy until you find food). Now put this in perspective: eating every day, in fact, 3-4 times a day, insulin raises every time we eat, especially with refined carbohydrates, but it can also do protein and fat. Obesity rates are soaring all over the world(reason above). Insulin can be good and can also be equally harmful. Excess insulin leads to Diabetes, Inflammation, Atherosclerosis(Heart Disease), Obesity Etc



- Ashok Krish - Detested memorizing stuff. Exams are test of time than knowledge and analytical ability. Understand things from first principles, basic heuristics , models & metamodels. Avoid Hard manual labour, picks things that can be broken down and mastered. In terms of Indian cooking, tacit knowledge is no where captured. Health and nutrition is very complex subject.
    - Fats - they dont undergo any chemical changes till they reach intestine. Essentially replacement for Water at High temperature. 
    - Fats do not cause insulin spike 
    - Need certain amount of Fats.avoid trans-fats & refined oils. Always use refined oil for frying. 
    - Moderate ghee, butter are fine.
    - All spice flavours are fat soluble. Always spice add powders at the end and whole spices in fat i.e. Oil.
    - Carbohydrates, 
        - try to eat those has much fiber..Potatoes are better than grains.
    - Avoid direct sugars. 
    - Salt & Sugar sensors are at the tip of the tongue.
    - Avoid any liquid that has sugar in it. 
    - Cook vegetables and meat separately as both require different kind of heat. 
    - People tend to skeptical when it comes to food which is natural. 
    - Cooking generally has some degree of undoing like acid for bitter, dehydrate if soggy etc.

- Food and Health
    - Potato is starch which gets converted into Glucose. Glucose is less damaging than fructose.
    - Sugar is 50-50% fructose and glucose. Glucose gets absorbed by Body, fructose can be processed only by Liver and gets converted to Fat.
    - For a healthy heart, keep ratio triglycerides to HDL should be 2 or less.
    -  avoid sugar, fructose, fine flour and vegetable oil
    - Human body is optimized for fasting and feasting 
    - Human body has enough vitamins and other nutrients for many days.
    - It’s the combination of sugar, fat, and salt that make foods ‘hyper-palatable’ and drives us to want and eat more
    - If you find you have certain foods that trigger you to overeat, don’t eat or keep these foods in the house. The more you decrease your exposure to these foods, the more likely you are to succeed with your diet. Studies suggest when people reduce the palatability of the diet, they’re more likely to succeed and keep the weight off in the long-term.
    - Serving foods with smaller plates may reduce the amount of food you eat and decrease calorie intake.
    - Don’t keep snacks around your desk while working. If you do want to grab a snack, make sure it’s kept in the office kitchen. The simple act of making it harder to get to will reduce the chances of mindless eating.
    - Pay attention. Don’t assume just because it’s called a salad, it’s zero-calorie and healthy. Most restaurants have the ingredients listed in the menu, check the salad to make sure there aren’t any extra toppings. If there are you can factor these into your calorie count for the day or simply ask the restaurant not add these when they make your food – remember, you’re paying them.

- First principles 
    - Process of Socratic questioning
        - Clarifying your thinking and explaining the origins of your ideas. (Why do I think this? What exactly do I think?) 
        - Challenging assumptions. (How do I know this is true? What if I thought the opposite?) 
        - Looking for evidence. (How can I back this up? What are the sources?) 
        - Considering alternative perspectives. (What might others think? How do I know I am correct?) 
        - Examining consequences and implications. (What if I am wrong? What are the consequences if I am?) 
        - Questioning the original questions. (Why did I think that? Was I correct? What conclusions can I draw from the reasoning process?) 
    
    - Reasoning from first principles allows us to step outside of history and conventional wisdom and see what is possible. When you really understand the principles at work, you can decide if the existing methods make sense. Often they don’t.  Many people mistakenly believe that creativity is something that only some of us are born with, and either we have it or we don’t. Fortunately, there seems to be ample evidence that this isn’t true. We’re all born rather creative, but during our formative years, it can be beaten out of us by busy parents and teachers. As adults, we rely on convention and what we’re told because that’s easier than breaking things down into first principles and thinking for yourself. Thinking through first principles is a way of taking off the blinders. Most things suddenly seem more possible. 

- Psychology 
    - Everything comes with an inherent sacrifice
    - What creates our positive experiences will define our negative experiences

- Charles' Rules of Argument  (https://fishbowl.pastiche.org/2004/03/21/charles_rules_of_argument)
    -  You will never change anyone's mind on a matter of opinion. People change their minds gradually, and if anything a prolonged argument only serves to back someone into a corner, huddling closer to the security blanket of what they believe. 
    - Never seek out things to disagree with. There are too many of them out there, and correcting the ills of the world just isn't your job.
    - If you come across something you disagree with while randomly browsing, let it pass without comment (see rule 1). If it's truly frustrating, write a reply, then delete it without sharing it with anyone else.
    - Even in the limited scope remaining, it is not your job to correct everything you find that you disagree with. Try to limit yourself to things where the subject is at least something that makes some practical difference to your life.
    - Do not argue about politics, religion, or matters of personal taste or comparative morality.
    - DO NOT argue with Lisp programmers, believers in the Semantic Web, or furries.
    - Saying something controversial in your own space (i.e. your weblog) is only arguing if you directly reference somebody you are disagreeing with (or it is clearly understood in subtext who you are disagreing with), and that person is likely to give a shit about what you said.
    -  If someone disagrees with something you've said, you're already in an argument. 
    - Once you find yourself in an argument, your job is now to make your point clearly, and then leave.
        - State your case - Once you have stated your case, there's no point re-stating it.Going over the same ground repeatedly will damage your case.
        - Clarify any misunderstandings 
        - The ideal attitude to project during any argument is one of calm disinterest. 
        - Any emotional involvement you show is a weakness that can be exploited by your opponent.Even being passionate about your subject is dangerous, because over time passion becomes zeal, and zeal becomes shrillness.
