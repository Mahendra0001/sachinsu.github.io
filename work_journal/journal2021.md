- Auto Market in India
    - Mainly small car market 
    - middle class consumption explosion never realized 
    - Between Maruti (48%) and Hyndai (12$), they control 60%+ of passenger car market 
    - Other Global companies could never thrive in small car market. Basically, they entered india with expectation that over the period of time trend will shift to bigger cars but that hasn't happened.

- TSMC 
    - World's largest Contract manufacturer of Semiconductors and chips 
    - Most of world's devices have some component made by them 
    - It got immense traction during move to handheld (Smartphone, tab ...) from PC 
    - AMD, Qualcomm design the chips and outsource manufacturing entirely to companies like TSMC 
    - Mediatek is another taiwanese company but they design and manufacture their own processors.

- Very nice write up by Morgan Housel on beliefs, 
    - Other people's bad circumstances cudnt happen to you is a illusion 
    - Imagining an unrealistic world where progress and success don’t demand a fee, and a belief that hassle, nonsense, disagreement and uncertainty are bugs rather than a cost of admission to getting ahead.
    - An assumption that your view of the world is the view of the world, and a belief that what you’ve seen and experienced are the sights and experiences that explain how the world works.

- Cyclical nature of industry
    - buy sugar company on the news that sugar prices have gone up. The industry goes through cycles and that higher prices means more sugar will be produced resulting in oversupply next year 

- Faster housing financing
    - Securing a loan from Bank for Homes often takes time because of the processes they follow like due diligence, underwriting and so on. Nowadays, all-cash bidders are preferred over others by sellers. Instead of months it takes to secure loan from bank for a house,  There are companies (flyhomes.com) who buy the property on behalf of buyer in all-cash deals. They later sell it to buyer after few weeks when their loan is approved by bank. They are called cash offer companies. They make money through commisions and/or fees like between 1% to 3% of purchase price.This is example of financial engineering filling in gaps in market.
