- Equity investments
    - The best time to buy stocks is often when it feels the worst.

- Economy
    - The real economy starts, succeeds, and persists only with enough agricultural surplus to free the people for a division of labor, allowing for the existence of IBM, 3M, and McDonald’s itself. Without that agricultural surplus, the entire economy collapses; real and monetary sectors alike.
    - We have agricultural and extractive sectors at the base, heavy manufacturing sectors in the middle, and light manufacturing at the top, with service sectors intertwined throughout, serving the agricultural, extractive, and manufacturing industries in addition to household consumers.\
    - When you purchase stock through an initial public offering, you’re either helping yet another corporation take root, or an existing one expand its operations.
    - the economy grows as an integrated whole, and so does the stock market. If you’re helping one sector, you’re essentially helping them all. You may not be assisting every business competitor when you purchase a particular stock, but you are helping to expand a sector, and therefore the economy at large.

- Need for Observability
    - The higher the SLO/SLA of the service, the more observability it will require.
- Warren buffet on Stocks vs. Bonds
    - In High inflationary environment, both underperform.
    -  Investors in stocks are stuck with whatever return corporate America happens to earn. This is against fixed returns provided by Bonds.
    - To raise that return on equity, corporations would need at least one of the following:
    - an increase in turnover, i.e., in the ratio between sales and total assets employed in the business;
        - cheaper leverage;
        - more leverage;
        - lower income taxes;
        - wider operating margins on sales.
    And that’s it. There simply are no other ways to increase returns on co
    - future results will be governed by three variables: 
        - the relationship between book value and market value, 
        - the tax rate,
        -  the inflation rate.
    - If a stock has a book value of $100 and also an average market value of $100, 12 percent earnings by business will produce a 12 percent return for the investor (less those frictional costs, which we’ll ignore for the moment). If the payout ratio is 50 percent, our investor will get $6 via dividends and a further $6 from the increase in the book value of the business, which will, of course, be reflected in the market value of his holdings.If the stock sold at 150 percent of book value, the picture would change. The investor would receive the same $6 cash dividend, but it would now represent only a 4 percent return on his $150 cost. The book value of the business would still increase by 6 percent (to $106) and the market value of the investor’s holdings, valued consistently at 150 percent of book value, would similarly increase by 6 percent to ($159). But the investor’s total return, i.e., from appreciation plus dividends, would be only 10 percent versus the underlying 12 percent earned by the business. - When the investor buys in below book value, the process is reversed. For example, if the stock sells at 80 percent of book value, the same earnings and payout assumptions would yield 7.5 percent from dividends ($6 on an $80 prices) and 6 percent from appreciation—a total return of 13.5 percent.
