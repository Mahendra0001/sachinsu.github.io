At a High level, Tracfee&amp;rsquo;s Architecture involves,
 Single Page Application using VueJS, deployed on Netlify API in Go, deployed on Oracle Cloud  So far, API testing has been automated and we were looking at ways to automate deployment of both UI and API. Steps required to deploy API are less since we are using Docker to run it on VM.</description>

      <description>Using Channels to implement Producer Consumer pattern Background Recently, i got involved in assignment where in an application was facing issues with throughput. Expectation is to support more than 500 transactions per second while load testing results were indicating system was experiencing high latency beyond 100+ transactions per second.
This application is developed in .NET Framework + .NET Core and primarily uses Relational Database for persistence and has point to point integration (mainly over HTTP) with internal &amp;amp; external application(s).</description>

      <description>Using .NET standard Assembly in both .NET core and .NET Framework Background One of the key project(s) at my current organization is developed on .NET 4.6.1. It is developed as Modular Monolith. As part of it&amp;rsquo;s functionality, it supports different channels like Mobiles, Terminals and Web. For the Web channel, there was need to develop a Web application with,
 High availability Lightweight, High throughput (Need to support few thousand(s) active users)  Accordingly, we have been exploring developing this Web Application in .</description>
