## Introduction

We develop a piece of software with aim to fulfil specific business requirements in terms of resource usage, throughput etc. Profiling and benchmarking are approaches that developer has to evaluate the same. 

 - Profiling is defined as `aimed at  understanding the behaviour of a program. A profile result might be a table of time taken per function,` as per [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34801622/difference-between-benchmarking-and-profiling) and [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profiling_(computer_programming)))
 - Benchmarking is `measures the time for some whole operation. e.g. I/O operations per second under some workload. So the result is typically a single number, in either seconds or operations per second. Or a data set with results for different parameters, so you can graph it.`. Refer [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benchmark_(computing)) for more information. Also do check [Benchmarking correctly is hard by Julia Evans](https://jvns.ca/blog/2016/07/23/rigorous-benchmarking-in-reasonable-time/).

We will look at couple of easy to use tools in this space.
